The SPA application itself is more than the HTML and JavaScript running in a browser. A MEAN Stack includes more than the SPA client; it also needs an API server. It is sensible to keep project deployment scripts with the main repository. A well tested application will have integration and feature tests mapping to users behaviors; these are not part of the client or server, but should also be with the project.
