title: Project Layout
---

Choosing a project layout has a surprising number of consequences for a team. The Java approach and conventional wisdom separates projects along language and environment seams. There are separate folders for `main/` and `test/`, and separate folders for language, `src/scala/com/...` and `src/java/...`. Rails and Rails-like stacks split the project along OO seams, creating different directories for `app/` and `test/`. Inside `app/` and `test/` are folders for `controllers/` and `templates/`. These approaches place the framework concepts front and center, forcing developers to think about the tools first and the business model second. To go from a controller to a template requires navigating up and then back down the directory structure.

A better conceptual approach is to break the application along business model seams. There are good reasons for doing so: for one, it places the conceptual model of the business itself at the forefront of development. This allows for easier mixing & matching of the various transpiled languages. Putting the business model and logic first builds in an ubiquitous language for the project, a useful concept from the field of Domain Driven Development. Team members see their business components first, and talk about the specific controller, schema, or template later. While mixing languages makes the build tools require more configuration, it usually falls to the difference in moving `coffee/**` to `**/*.coffee`. Teams can choose languages that are most comfortable to their style concerns.

After building a sensible project layout, teams can choose which of the various transpiled programming languages to use for various types of code. Broadly, the codebase has: scripts, bits of executable code; markup, declarations that will create the DOM structure; and styling, declarations to style portions of the DOM. These script types will need to be coordinated through a build system. Because SPAs are served as a collection of a half-dozen minified, compressed, cacheable files, this build process is the link between your one-module-per-file source directory, and your final `application.js` file.

### [Areas](./01_areas)

Before building the SPA, I recommend breaking your source code into four primary areas, within the root of your project. The first five recipes describe each of these areas -- what they're used for, what types of files live in them, and a recommended layout for components inside those modules.

1. **[Root](./01_areas/01_root)**
1. **[Deploy](./01_areas/02_deploy)**
1. **[Server](./01_areas/03_server)**
1. **[Client](./01_areas/04_client)**
1. **[Features](./01_areas/05_features)**

### Languages

1. **script**: *JavaScript* vs *Coffee* vs *Dart*
1. **markup**: *HTML* vs *Jade*
1. **styling**: *css* vs *Stylus* vs *SASS* vs *Less*

### Build Toolchain

1. **Grunt** *Task Configuration*
1. **Gulp** *Build Pipelines*
1. **Closure Compiler** *Static type safety*

### Static Typing
